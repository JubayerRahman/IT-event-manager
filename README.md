## 5 features about my project TechEevent pros

Here are 5 features of my project. This was a challenging and at the same time very exciting project. I learned some new coding techniques and practiced old ones. However, making the design from scratch without any suggestions was a bit challenging. Well, I did my best, to be honest, I did my best with the design and coding. Doing the backend or log in or registration authentication was exciting. Okay, here are some of the features I think are unique.

#### 1. This website was built for a company that plans and manages IT events, seminars, and boot camps for other companies, institutes, and organizations. So, I made the design based on their theme or operations. I tried to make the design simple and easy to understand. My focus was to make the website easy to use for everyone.
#### 2. The feature I think will be the main focus of the website is the Login and registration authentication. Visitors can register with their Gmail and  Get access to the website. and if you have a account you can simply log in 
#### 3. if you don't feel like registering yourself in the system no worries, you can simply sign in or log in with your google account. Isn't it great?
#### 4. Now let's talk see, why should A visitor register on the website. Because without registration a visitor cant lean everything about our operations and services. because I made some necessary routes private only for registered users and in order to access the routes a visitor has to register or log in.
#### 5. This is a responsive website for all devices. that means a visitor can visit it from a mobile, tablet, or pc it will give them the same user experience. Of course, the UI will change based on the screen size but they are managed based on the standard screen sizes.
